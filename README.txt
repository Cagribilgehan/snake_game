Snake Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and Pygame. The project directory is structured as follows:

snake_game/
├── config.py
├── main.py
├── game.py
├── snake.py
├── food.py
├── utils/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── score.py
│   ├── game_over.py
├── audio/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── music.py
├── display/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── screen.py
├── snake_music.wav

Explanation of the Project Structure
config.py: Configuration settings for the game, such as colors and frame rate.
main.py: The main entry point of the game, responsible for initializing and starting the game.
game.py: Contains the main game loop and logic for handling events, updating game state, and rendering the game.
snake.py: Defines the Snake entity, including its movement, growth, and collision detection.
food.py: Defines the Food entity, including its position generation and drawing on the screen.
utils/: Contains utility scripts for handling score display and game over conditions.
init.py: Initializes the utils module.
score.py: Handles score display on the screen.
game_over.py: Handles the game over screen display.
audio/: Contains audio-related scripts and files.
init.py: Initializes the audio module.
music.py: Handles background music playback.
display/: Contains display-related scripts for setting up the game window.
init.py: Initializes the display module.
screen.py: Handles the creation of the game window.
snake_music.wav: The background music file for the game.
The project structure ensures that the game is modular and each component is separated, making it easier to manage and extend.
